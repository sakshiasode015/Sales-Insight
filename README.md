 Introduction

The Sales Insights Data Analysis Project focuses on analysing sales data to derive valuable insights that can aid in making informed business decisions. This report provides an overview of the project's objectives, data sources, analysis methods, and insights generated.

 Objectives

The main objectives of the Sales Insights Data Analysis Project are as follows:

1. Data Acquisition: Obtain relevant sales data for analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
3. SQL Analysis: Perform data analysis using SQL queries to extract meaningful information.
4. Power BI Analysis: Utilize Power BI for data visualization and further analysis.
5. Insight Generation: Derive insights from the analyzed data to inform business strategies.

 Data Sources

The project utilizes a sales dataset that includes information about customers, transactions, markets, products, and dates. This dataset serves as the foundation for deriving insights about sales patterns, customer behaviors, and revenue trends.

 SQL Analysis

Several SQL queries were employed to extract relevant information from the dataset. The queries covered various aspects of the sales data, including customer records, transactions, market-specific details, and revenue calculations. Notable queries include:

- Retrieving customer records.
- Calculating the total number of customers.
- Identifying transactions in specific markets.
- Determining distinct product codes in specific markets.
- Filtering transactions by currency.
- Joining transactions with date information.
- Calculating total revenue for specific years, months, and markets.

 Power BI Analysis

Power BI was used to create visualizations that aid in understanding the data more comprehensively. Key visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, and pivot tables. Additionally, a custom column named `norm_amount` was created to normalize sales amounts based on currency.

 Insights

The analysis of the sales data led to several valuable insights:

1. Market Analysis: Transactions in specific markets, such as Chennai (Mark001), exhibited varying sales patterns.
2. Currency Impact: Sales in different currencies, including USD, contributed to revenue fluctuations.
3. Temporal Trends: Revenue analysis for different years and months highlighted seasonal trends.
4. Customer Engagement: The total number of customers provided insight into customer base growth.

 Conclusion

The Sales Insights Data Analysis Project demonstrates the significance of data analysis in understanding sales trends and making strategic decisions. By leveraging SQL queries and Power BI, this project offers insights into customer behavior, revenue streams, and market dynamics. The resulting insights equip businesses with actionable information to enhance sales strategies and optimize performance.
